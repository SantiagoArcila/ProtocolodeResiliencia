#+STARTUP: hidestars

* Project
- [ ] graph creation
- [ ] transaction (path finding with the rules)
- [ ] network distribution

** TODO january [3/3]
- [X] rewrite and check some tests
- [X] rewrite node tests since we are now storing the node id not the whole structure
- [X] test graph creation

** TODO february [0/3]
- [ ] ensure tree structure (no loops like A-B-C-A) *Edge A-B same as B-A, nodes can have multiple edges.
- [ ] edges carry data (at least value, %, "transaction direction")
- [ ] read the graph from a dot file or csv (to decide)

** TODO march [0/4]
- [ ] generate an image or the given graph
- [ ] add the necessary information for each node, balance, tasa propia, tasa publica, adicionales, valor acumulado,
	this can be done having the ets tables like shown on this article

at first glance we will be the ones that manually create the 
graph to ensure that it has no cycles and has a tree 
structure, we can use the methods of this library to assert that
