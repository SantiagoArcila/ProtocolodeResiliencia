- [X] rewrite node tests since we are now storing the node id not the whole structure
- [X] test graph creation

** TODO february [0/3]
- [ ] ensure tree structure (no loops like A-B-C-A) *Edge A-B same as B-A, nodes can have multiple edges.
- [ ] edges carry data (at least value, %, "transaction direction")
- [ ] read the graph from a dot file or csv (to decide)
