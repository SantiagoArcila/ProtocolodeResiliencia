#+STARTUP: hidestars

* Project
- [ ] graph creation
- [ ] transaction (path finding with the rules)
- [ ] network distribution

** TODO january [3/3]
- [X] rewrite and check some tests
- [X] rewrite node tests since we are now storing the node id not the whole structure
- [X] test graph creation

** TODO february [0/3]

- [ ] ensure unidirectional graph (edge B-A can't be made if A-B already exists)
- [ ] ensure tree structure (no loops like A-B-C-A)
- [ ] edges carry data (value, %)
